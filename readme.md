# ExpenseTracker 3D

Educational project ExpenseTracker 3D combines a powerful Python/Flask backend with an immersive Three.js frontend to create an engaging personal finance tool. At its core, a well-structured relational database, managed by SQLAlchemy, handles all user data, transactions, and achievements with efficiency and integrity. The entire UI is rendered over a live 3D scene, offering a unique user experience.

### Interactive 3D Experience
The application greets users with a fully interactive 3D landing page and maintains this animated background throughout the user journey, creating a unique and immersive feel. The background features a central 3D logo and animated particles that subtly react to mouse movements.
